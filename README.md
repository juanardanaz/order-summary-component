## My process

Instead of import fonts from Google Fonts, I decided to use the @font-face property.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) - This helped me to convert font from TTF/OTF to woff2 format.
- [Shape Divider](https://www.shapedivider.app/) - This is an amazing SVG shape generator which helped me to create the background.
